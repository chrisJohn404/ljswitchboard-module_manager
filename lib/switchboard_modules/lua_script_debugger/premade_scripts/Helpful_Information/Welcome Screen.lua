print("Welcome, please Load an example to get started!")

--Overview----------------------------------------------------------------

--The T7 has an internal Lua v5.1 interpreter and compiler which are
--used to build and execute small Lua scripts.  This section
--of Kipling is dedicated to transferring the script files to the
--T7, and then reading the interpreted output in the console.  Because 
--scripts are sent as plain text to the T7, compiler errors are handled by
--the T7, not the Kipling IDE.  LabJack recommends firmware 1.0134 or newer.
--Old firmware is not good at handling Lua syntax and compiler errors.


--Helpful tips-------------------------------------------------------------

--'if' statements should be followed by 'then'
--'while' and 'if' statements require an 'end' after the code block
--We recommend limiting script length to ~300 lines or less
--Some functions of Lua are not available (to reduce stack size)
--See 'LabJack Lua functions' code example for a list of integrated functions
--Functions are limited to those in eLua core (embedded Lua)
