    Desc: This example will output whatever is on AIN0 and configure a PWM wave
    Note: In most cases, users should throttle their code execution using the
          functions: "LJ.IntervalConfig(0, 1000)", and "if check_interval(0)"

          Users must first configure a digital I/O for PWM out, and save those
          settings as defaults. After PWM output is enabled, the duty cycle can
          be updated easily by changing DIO0_EF_CONFIG_A:
            http://labjack.com/support/datasheets/t7/digital-io/extended-features/pwm-out

          On a T7 (FW 1.0282) this example runs at around 13kHz
          On a T4 (FW 1.0023) this example runs at around 10kHz
