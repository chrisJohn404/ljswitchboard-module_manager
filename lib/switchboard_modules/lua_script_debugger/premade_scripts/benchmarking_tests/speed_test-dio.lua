    Desc: This example will output a digital waveform on FIO3
          (FIO5 if using a T4) as fast as possible
    Note: In most cases, users should throttle their code execution using the
          functions: "LJ.IntervalConfig(0, 1000)", and "if check_interval(0)"

          On a T7 (FW 1.0282) this example runs at around 23kHz
          On a T4 (FW 1.0023) this example runs at around 24kHz

          This example requires firmware 1.0282 (T7) or 1.0023 (T4)
