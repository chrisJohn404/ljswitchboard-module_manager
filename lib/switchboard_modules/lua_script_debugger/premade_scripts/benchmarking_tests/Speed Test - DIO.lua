print("Benchmarking Test: Toggle the digital I/O called FIO3 as fast as possible.")
--This example will output a digital waveform at ~16kHz to ~18kHz on FIO3
--It is NOT RECOMMENDED for users to structure their code as is done in this benchmarking test.
--Most commonly users should throttle their code execution using the functions:
--'LJ.IntervalConfig(0, 1000)', and 'if LJ.CheckInterval(0) then' ...


--The throttle setting can correspond roughly with the length of the Lua script.
--A rule of thumb for deciding a throttle setting is Throttle = (3*NumLinesCode) + 20
ThrottleSetting = 48    --Default throttle setting is 10 instructions
